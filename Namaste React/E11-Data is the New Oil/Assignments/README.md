## Namaste React Course by Akshay Saini
# Chapter 11 - Data is the new oil

## Theory
- What is `prop drilling`?
- What is `lifting the state up`?
- What are `Context Provider` and `Context Consumer`?
- If you `don't pass a value to the provider does it take the default value`?

## Coding
- Practice `React Context with code examples`
- Try out `Nested Contexts`
