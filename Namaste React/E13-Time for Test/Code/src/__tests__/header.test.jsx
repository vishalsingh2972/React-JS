/* NOTE:

By wrapping the <Header/> component with both <BrowserRouter> and <Provider>, you're providing it with the necessary context to function correctly in isolation.

Here's what each wrapper does:
- <BrowserRouter>: Provides the routing context, allowing the Link component to work properly. This is necessary because the Header component uses Link from react-router-dom.
- <Provider store={appStore}>: Reconnects the isolated Header component to the Redux store. This is necessary because the Header component uses useSelector to access the Redux store's state.
