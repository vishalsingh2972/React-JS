## Q: Is `JSX` mandatory for React?
A: `JSX` is an Extension Syntax that allows writing HTML and Javascript together easily in React and is used to create React elements. These elements are then rendered to the React DOM. Each JSX element is just to make use of React easy and for calling React.createElement(component, props, …children) with less work. So, anything that is done with JSX can also be done with just plain JavaScript. So `JSX` is not mandatory but is used for writing better and clean code instead of writing code using `React.CreateElement`.
#### Example of `JSX`
```
const sample = <h2>Greetings</h2>;
```


In short,
JSX is a syntax that is used for writing better and clean code insted of writing code using React.CreateElement. It is not mandatory to use JSX but makes things much simpler and smoother for React, hence it's widely adopted and considered a best practice.



JSX => It's an extension of Javascript which allows us to write HTML like syntax in JavaScript. It makes it really easier to create and manipulate dynamic interfaces. This HTML like syntax is transformed into standard JS objects using a transpiler such a Babel.
e.g: JSX: const element = <button className="btn btn-primary">Click me</button>;
Converted into JS: const element = React.createElement("button", { className: "btn btn-primary" }, "Click me");



No, `JSX` is not mandatory for React, but it is the recommended and widely used way of defining the structure of your user interfaces when working with React. React can be used without JSX, but JSX makes the process of defining and working with components in React much more convenient and readable.
We can write React components using plain JavaScript functions or classes, and create React elements using `React.createElement` function. However, this approach can be less intuitive and more verbose compared to JSX.
Here's an example of creating a React component and element without JSX:
```
const element = React.createElement('h1', null, 'Hello, React without JSX!');

class App extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return React.createElement('div', null, element);
  }
}
```
As you can see, it's less readable and more cumbersome compared to the JSX equivalent:

```
const element = <h1>Hello, React with JSX!</h1>;

class App extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return <div>{element}</div>;
  }
}
```
While JSX is not mandatory, it is highly recommended for most React development because it provides a more natural and expressive way to define the structure of your components and is widely adopted by the React community. JSX is also the approach you will find in most React documentation and tutorials.

## Q: Is `ES6` mandatory for React?
A: `ES6` is not mandatory for `React` but is highly recommendable. The latest projects created on React rely a lot on ES6. React uses ES6, and you should be familiar with some of the new features like: Classes, Arrow Functions, Variables(let, const).
ES6 stands for ECMAScript 6. ECMAScript was created to standardize JavaScript, and ES6 is the 6th version of ECMAScript, it was published in 2015.


`ES6 (ECMAScript 2015)` is not mandatory for React, but it is highly recommended and widely used in React development. React itself does not require ES6, and we can write React applications using older versions of JavaScript, such as ES5. 
However, using ES6 or a more recent version of JavaScript has several advantages:

`Enhanced Syntax` - ES6 introduces many features and syntactical improvements that make our code more concise and readable. Features like `arrow functions`, `template literals`, `destructuring`, and `classes` can significantly improve our code quality and maintainability.

`Module System` - ES6 introduced a standardized module system, allowing us to use `import` and `export` statements for better code organization and dependency management in React applications.

`Arrow Functions` - Arrow functions provide a more concise way to define functions, and they have lexical scoping, making it easier to work with this in React components.

`Class Syntax` - ES6 class syntax is commonly used for defining React components, providing a clear and more structured way to create components.

`Default Parameters` - ES6 allows us to set default parameter values for function arguments, which can make our code more robust.

`Spread and Rest Operators` - These operators are useful for working with arrays and objects, which are common in React applications.

`Template Literals` - Template literals provide a more convenient way to work with strings.

However, adopting ES6 and modern JavaScript practices is generally recommended for a more productive and maintainable React development experience.

## Q: `{TitleComponent}` vs `{<TitleComponent/>}` vs `{<TitleComponent></TitleComponent>}` in `JSX`.
A: The Difference is stated below:
- `{TitleComponent}`: This value describes the `TitleComponent` as a javascript expression or a variable or React element. 
The `{}` can embed a javascript expression or a variable or React element inside it.
- `<TitleComponent/>` : This value represents a Component that is basically returning some JSX value. In simple terms `TitleComponent` a function that is returning a JSX value. If component is written inside the `{<  />}` expression the JSX returned by that component is used to create the UI element, basically when you write a component name inside curly braces ({}), it instructs React to render the component on the frontend. 
- `<TitleComponent></TitleComponent>` :  `<TitleComponent />` and `<TitleComponent></TitleComponent>` are equivalent only when `< TitleComponent />` has no child components. The opening and closing tags are created to include the child components.
#### Example
```
<TitleComponent>
    <FirstChildComponent />
    <SecondChildComponent />
    <ThirdChildComponent />
</TitleComponent>
```

---
## Q: How can I write `comments` in JSX?
A: JSX comments are written as follows:
- `{/*  */}` - for single or multiline comments
#### Example
```
{/* A JSX comment */}
{/* 
  Multi
  line
  JSX
  comment
*/}  
```
```
will look something like this: const sample = {/* <h2> Greetings </h2>; */};
```


You can write comments in JSX using curly braces {} and JavaScript-style comments within them. 
`Single-Line Comments` - We can use JavaScript's single-line comment syntax within curly braces. This is useful for adding comments on a single line within your JSX code.
**Example:**
```
<div>
    {/* This is a single-line comment */}
    <p>Hello, World!</p>
</div>
```
`Multi-Line Comments` - If we want to add multi-line comments within our JSX code, we can use JavaScript's block comment syntax within curly braces.
**Example:**
```
<div>
    {/*
        This is a multi-line comment.
        You can use it for longer explanations.
    */}
    <p>Hello, World!</p>
</div>
```
It's important to note that these comments are for documentation and readability purposes and do not appear in the final rendered HTML. They are stripped out during the compilation of JSX into JavaScript, so they won't affect the behavior of your application.

## Q: What is `<React.Fragment></React.Fragment>` and `<></>`?
A: `<React.Fragment></React.Fragment>` is a feature in React that allows you to return multiple elements from a React component by allowing you to group a list of children without adding extra nodes to the DOM.
`<></>` is the shorthand tag for `React.Fragment`. The only difference between them is that the shorthand version does not support the key attribute.
#### Example
```
return (
        <React.Fragment>
            <Header />
            <Navigation />
            <Main />
            <Footer />
        </React.Fragment>
    );

return (
        <>
            <Header />
            <Navigation />
            <Main />
            <Footer />
        </>
    );
```


- `React.Fragment` is a functional component that is provided by react. `<React.Fragment></React.Fragment>` is an empty tag that does not create extra `div` tag.
- `<></>` and `<React.Fragment></React.Fragment>` are similer tags. We can use empty tags in place of `<React.Fragment></React.Fragment>` as well.


Both `<React.Fragment></React.Fragment>` and `<></>` are used in React to define `fragments`. Fragments are a way to group multiple children without adding an extra DOM element. They are often used when we need to return multiple elements from a component's render method but don't want to wrap them in a container element like div. 
Making our code cleaner and more semantically meaningful. 
1 `<React.Fragment></React.Fragment>` 
We can use the `<React.Fragment>` component to create a fragment in our JSX. This is especially useful when we need to return multiple elements, but we don't want to introduce a wrapping container element in our rendered output. We can also add key and other props to the fragment.
**Example:**
```
import React from 'react';

function MyComponent() {
    return (
        <React.Fragment>
            <p>First paragraph</p>
            <p>Second paragraph</p>
        </React.Fragment>
    );
}
```
2. `<></> (Short Syntax, introduced in React 16.2)`
The short syntax `<></>` is a more concise way to create fragments in React. It has the same purpose as `<React.Fragment>`, but it doesn't require the React import, and it's often preferred for brevity.
Example:
```
function MyComponent() {
    return (
        <>
            <p>First paragraph</p>
            <p>Second paragraph</p>
        </>
    );
}
```

## Q: What is Virtual DOM?
A: Virtual DOM is representation of the real DOM.


✔️Tha Document Object model or real dom represents the web page as a tree struture(html elements) with the help of javascript we can accesses and modify it. 
✔️virtual DOM is copy of real dom.

## Q: What is `Reconciliation` in React?
A: `Reconciliation` is the process through which React updates the Browser DOM and makes React work faster. React use a `diffing algorithm` so that component updates are predictable and faster. React would first calculate the difference between the real DOM and the copy of DOM (Virtual DOM) when there's an update of components.
React stores a copy of Browser DOM which is called `Virtual DOM`. When we make changes or add data, React creates a new Virtual DOM and compares it with the previous one. Comparison is done by `Diffing Algorithm`.
React compares the Virtual DOM with Real DOM. It finds out the changed nodes and updates only the changed nodes in Real DOM leaving the rest nodes as it is. This process is called Reconciliation.


Reconciliation is a process in React where it uses a diffing algorithm to compare the previous virtual DOM (a lightweight representation of the UI) with the new virtual DOM after a change in state or props. This comparison allows React to identify the minimal set of changes needed to update the actual DOM in the browser. As a result, React can efficiently update only the necessary parts of the UI without re-rendering the entire page or reloading all elements.


`Reconciliation` in React refers to the process by which React updates the DOM (Document Object Model) to match the most recent state of the application. React uses a virtual representation of the DOM called the "Virtual DOM" to efficiently update the actual DOM. 
Reconciliation is the algorithmic process of comparing the previous virtual DOM with the current one and making the necessary changes to bring the actual DOM in sync with the application's state.
Here's how the reconciliation process works in React
1. `Render Phase` - During the render phase, React creates a virtual representation of the component tree. This virtual tree is called the Virtual DOM. React elements are created for each component and its children, representing the component's structure and content.
2. `Reconciliation Phase` - When there's a change in the component's state or props, a new virtual tree is created. React then performs a process called `reconciliation` to compare the new virtual tree with the previous one.
React uses a `diffing algorithm` to identify the differences (or "diffs") between the new and previous virtual trees.
It determines which parts of the virtual tree need to be updated in the actual DOM to reflect the changes in the component's state or props.
React aims to minimize the number of actual DOM operations to make the update as efficient as possible.
3. `Commit Phase` - After identifying the differences in the virtual tree, React applies the necessary changes to the actual DOM. This is called the `commit phase`. During this phase, React updates the DOM to reflect the changes in the virtual tree. The updates are batched and performed efficiently to minimize browser repaints and reflows.
`Reconciliation` is a critical aspect of React's performance optimization.


In short, Reconciliation is a process, where react uses it's diffing algorithm to find the differemce between the trees (i.e. real and virtual DOM) to render the changes.

## Q: What is `React Fiber`?
A: React Fiber is a concept of ReactJS that is used to render a system faster, smoother and smarter.
The Fiber reconciler, which became the default reconciler for React 16 and above, is a complete rewrite of React’s reconciliation algorithm to solve some long-standing issues in React.
Because Fiber is asynchronous, React can:
- Pause, resume, and restart rendering work on components as new updates come in
- Reuse previously completed work and even abort it if not needed
- Split work into chunks and prioritize tasks based on importance


React fiber is a new reconciliatoin engine in React 16.


`React Fiber`, often referred to simply as `Fiber` is an internal and ongoing reimplementation of the React reconciliation algorithm. It was introduced by the React team to address some limitations and performance bottlenecks in the original reconciliation 
process.
The primary goals of React Fiber are:
`Improved Rendering` - Fiber introduces a new, more efficient algorithm for rendering components. It allows React to break down rendering work into smaller units and prioritize the work more effectively. This enables React to be more responsive, especially in high-load and concurrent rendering scenarios.
`Incremental Rendering` - Fiber enables React to perform rendering incrementally, `pausing` and `resuming` work as needed. This means that React can work on rendering parts of the component tree without blocking the main thread, resulting in smoother and more responsive user interfaces.
`Concurrent Mode` - Fiber introduced the concept of Concurrent Mode, which allows React to handle multiple tasks and updates concurrently. It prioritizes user interactions and ensures that they are not blocked by rendering tasks, improving the user experience.
`Support for Async Rendering` - With Fiber, React can handle asynchronous rendering tasks more effectively, enabling features like suspense and lazy loading of components.
In short,
- Pause, resume, and restart rendering work on components as new updates come in.
- Reuse previously completed work and even abort it if not needed.
- Split work into chunks and prioritize tasks based on importance.

## Q: Why do we need `keys` in React? When do we need keys in React?
A `key` is a special attribute you need to include when creating lists of elements in React. Keys are used in React to identify which items in the list are changed, updated, or deleted. In other words, we can say that keys are unique Identifier used to give an identity to the elements in the lists.
Keys should be given to the elements within the array to give the elements a stable identity.
#### Example
```
<li key={0}>1</li>
<li key={1}>2</li>
<li key={2}>3</li>
```

- Keys are the unique identifire through which react knows, how to render a perticuler component.
- Keys are required when a paarent tag has two or more similer tags in it, so that react can update the component which is needed to be updated without destroying the whole paarent component. It improves the effieciency of the application.


In React, the key prop is used to help React identify and differentiate between elements in a collection, such as when rendering a list of components or elements. 
`Keys` are essential for efficient and reliable rendering, and they serve several important purposes:

`Performance` - React uses keys to optimize the update process. When a component in a collection is modified, React can use the keys to identify exactly which item changed. This enables React to update only the changed component in the virtual DOM and minimize the number of DOM manipulations required, which significantly improves performance.

`Preventing Reordering` - Keys ensure that the order of elements in a collection remains consistent. Without keys, React may not be able to distinguish between elements effectively, leading to unintended reordering when elements are added, removed, or modified. Keys help maintain the desired order of elements.

`Maintaining Component State` - When we have stateful components in a list, using keys is crucial. Without keys, the component instances may not be properly reused or preserved when the list changes, potentially leading to unexpected behavior and the loss of component state.

`Accessibility` - When dealing with lists or collections of elements, having unique and consistent keys can improve the accessibility of our application. It helps screen readers and assistive technologies provide a more meaningful experience to users.

`Child Component Identity` - In some cases, we may need to interact with child components directly. Keys provide a way to reference and interact with specific child components within a parent component.

However, it's important to note that keys should be unique among siblings but don't necessarily have to be globally unique. React uses keys to establish a relationship between the virtual DOM elements and the actual DOM elements. As such, keys are primarily used within the scope of the parent component to identify its children.
When choosing keys, it's a good practice to use stable and unique identifiers for elements, such as database IDs, UUIDs, or indices, depending on your data source. Avoid using random or non-unique values as keys, as they can lead to unexpected rendering behavior and performance issues.

**Example** :

```
<li key={0}>HTML</li>
<li key={1}>CSS</li>
<li key={2}>JavaScript</li>
<li key={3}>React</li>
```
---

## Q: Can we use `index as keys` in React?
A: Yes, we can use the `index as keys`, but it is not considered as a good practice to use them because if the order of items may change. This can negatively impact performance and may cause issues with component state, so as per React documentation you can use index as keys but it is not a good practice.
Keys are taken from each object which is being rendered. There might be a possibility that if we modify the incoming data react may render them in unusual order.


Yes, we can use the `index as keys` in React, but it should be done with caution and only in specific situations where we are certain that the list of items in your component is `static and won't change`. Using the index as keys can have limitations and potential issues, so it's important to understand when it's appropriate and when it's not.
Here are some key points to consider when using the index as keys:

`Static Lists` - The index can be used as a key when rendering a `static list of items`, where the order and the items themselves won't change. If our list is dynamic and items can be added, removed, or reordered, using the index as keys is not recommended, as it can lead to unexpected rendering issues.

`Performance` - Using the index as keys is less efficient in terms of performance, especially when elements can be added or removed from the list. `React may not be able to distinguish between items effectively`, leading to unnecessary re-renders and potentially impacting the performance of our application.

`Stable and Unique` - If we decide to use the index as keys, ensure that the list order remains stable. Any change in the list order can lead to incorrect rendering. Additionally, it's essential to use unique keys for each item in the list, as duplicate keys can lead to issues.

In general, it's a better practice to use stable and unique identifiers as keys whenever possible. For dynamic lists of items fetched from a database or an external data source, it's recommended to use unique IDs associated with each item. If you don't have access to unique IDs, consider generating unique keys based on the content of the items or using other methods to ensure that keys are both stable and unique.

While using the index as keys can be a quick solution for simple and static lists, it's crucial to be aware of its limitations and potential issues in more complex and dynamic scenarios. Always consider the specific requirements and characteristics of our application when deciding on the appropriate keying strategy.

## Q: What is `props in React`? Ways to.
A: props stands for properties. Props are arguments passed into React components. props are used in React to pass data from one component to another (from a parent component to a child component(s)). They are useful when you want the flow of data in your app to be dynamic.
#### Example
```
function App() {
  return (
    <div className="App">
      <Tool name="Vishal Singh" tool="Figma"/> // name and tool are props
    </div>
  )
}
```


- Props or properties are just parameters that React component uses for any operation.


In React, `props (short for properties)` is a mechanism for passing data from a parent component to a child component. They allow us to make our React components dynamic and reusable by providing a way to configure and customize their behavior. Props are read-only, meaning that a child component cannot modify the props it receives from a parent.
To pass props to a child component, you can use the following methods:

1 `Inline Props (JSX Attribute)` - We can pass props directly in our JSX when rendering a child component. For example, if you have a name prop, we can pass it like this:

```
<ChildComponent name="John" />
```

2 `Using Variables` - We can pass JavaScript variables as props to a child component. 
For example:
```
const name = "John";
<ChildComponent name={name} />
```

3 `Dynamic Props` - We can pass dynamic values or the result of expressions as props. For instance, we can pass the result of a function:
```
<ChildComponent greeting={`Hello, ${getName()}`} />

/* Here, getName() is a function that returns a name. */
```

4 `Spread Attributes` - If you have an object with properties that you want to pass as props, you can use the spread operator (...) to pass all properties of the object as individual props:
```
const person = { name: "John", age: 30 };
<ChildComponent {...person} />
```
In the ChildComponent, we can access **name** and **age** as individual props.

In the child component, we can access these props using the props object. For example, in the ChildComponent, you can access the name prop as `props.name`.

Here's a simple example of how a parent component can pass props to a child component:
```
// ParentComponent.js
import React from "react";
import ChildComponent from "./ChildComponent";

function ParentComponent() {
  return <ChildComponent name="John" />;
}

// ChildComponent.js
import React from "react";

function ChildComponent(props) {
  return <p>Hello, {props.name}!</p>;
}

export default ChildComponent;
```

In this example, the ParentComponent passes a name prop to the ChildComponent, and the child component displays a message using that prop. This demonstrates the basic use of props in React.

## Q: What is `Config Driven UI`?
A: `Config Driven UI` are based on the configurations of the data application receives. It is rather a good practice to use config driven UIs to make application for dynamic. 
It is a very common & basic approach to interact with the User. It provides a generic interface to develop things which help your project scale well. It saves a lot of development time and effort.
A typical login form, common in most of the Apps. Most of these forms also get frequent updates as the requirements increase in terms of Form Validations, dropdown options,.. or design changes.


A `Config-Driven UI` (or `Configuration-Driven User Interface`) is an approach to building user interfaces where the structure, behavior, and appearance of the UI components are primarily determined by configuration data or settings, rather than hardcoding these details in the source code. This approach aims to make the user interface more flexible, customizable, and easily maintainable by separating the UI logic from the UI configuration.
Key aspects of a `Config-Driven UI` include:

`Configuration Data` - The UI components are driven by external configuration files or data, often in a structured format such as JSON, XML, YAML, or other custom formats. These configuration files define properties, layouts, styles, and even interactivity of UI elements.

`Dynamic UI Generation` - The UI components are generated and structured at runtime based on the provided configuration data. This allows for dynamic and flexible UI construction, making it easier to adapt to changes or customization requests.

`Customization` - Users or administrators can adjust the behavior and appearance of the UI without changing the underlying code. This is often achieved by modifying the configuration data, making it possible to tailor the UI to specific needs.

`Consistency and Reusability` - A configuration-driven approach promotes consistency across the UI by enforcing a standardized configuration schema. Reusable components and templates can be designed and shared across the application, leading to a more maintainable codebase.

`Rapid Development` - Config-driven UIs can accelerate development, as UI components can be designed and customized through configuration, reducing the need for extensive coding. This is particularly useful in situations where the UI needs to evolve quickly.

`Cross-Platform and Cross-Browser Compatibility` - A well-designed config-driven approach can help manage differences in UI rendering across different platforms and web browsers, as configuration data can be adjusted as needed for each platform or browser.

`Config-Driven UIs are commonly used in various contexts, including`:

`Content Management Systems (CMS)` - CMS platforms often allow users to define the structure and content of web pages through a configuration-driven approach.

`eCommerce Platforms` - Online stores often rely on configuration data to specify product catalogs, pricing, and promotional banners.

`Data Visualization` - Charting libraries may allow users to configure and customize chart elements via a configuration object.

`Business Applications`: Enterprise software often uses config-driven UIs to define forms, workflows, and dashboards that can be customized by administrators.

The exact implementation of a config-driven UI can vary depending on the technology and tools being used. In web development, this approach is often combined with front-end frameworks or libraries to render the UI based on the provided configuration. It provides the flexibility needed to create highly adaptable and user-customizable interfaces.

**Example**

- Offers in the Delivery apps differ from city to city where offer data come from a database.
- Restaurants in the Delivery apps differ from city to city where offer data comes from a database.

EXTRA QnA

## Q: Difference between `Virtual DOM` and `Real DOM`?
A: DOM stands for `Document Object Model`, which represents your application UI and whenever the changes are made in the application, this DOM gets updated and the user is able to visualize the changes. DOM is an interface that allows scripts to update the content, style, and structure of the document.
- `Virtual DOM`
    - The Virtual DOM is a light-weight abstraction of the DOM. You can think of it as a copy of the DOM, that can be updated without affecting the actual DOM. It has all the same properties as the real DOM object, but doesn’t have the ability to write to the screen like the real DOM.
    - Virtual DOM is just like a blueprint of a machine, can do the changes in the blueprint but those changes will not directly apply to the machine.
    - Reconciliation is a process to compare and keep in sync the two files (Real and Virtual DOM). Diffing algorithm is a technique of reconciliation which is used by React.
- `Real DOM`
    - The DOM represents the web page often called a document with a logical tree and each  branch of the tree ends in a node and each node contains object programmers can modify the content of the document using a scripting language like javascript and the changes and updates to the dom are fast because of its tree-like structure but after changes, the updated element and its children have to be re-rendered to update the application UI so the  re-rendering of the UI which make the dom slow all the UI components you need to be rendered for every dom update so real dom would render the entire list and not only those item that receives the update .

|   `Real DOM`    |   `Virtual DOM` |
|-------------|-----------------|
| DOM manipulation is very expensive  | DOM manipulation is very easy  | 
| There is too much memory wastage  | No memory wastage  |
| It updates Slow | It updates fast |
| It can directly update HTML | It can’t update HTML directly  |
|  Creates a new DOM if the element updates. | Update the JSX if the element update |
| It allows us to directly target any specific node (HTML element) | It can produce about 200,000 Virtual DOM Nodes / Second. |
| It represents the UI of your application | It is only a virtual representation of the DOM |
