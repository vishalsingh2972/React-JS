## Q: What is `Microservice`?
**A1:** `Microservice` - also known as the microservice architecture - is an architectural and organizational approach to software development where software is composed of small independent services like database, server or a UI of the application, that communicate over well-defined APIs. These services are owned by small, self-contained teams.
Microservices architectures make applications easier to scale and faster to develop, enabling innovation and accelerating time-to-market for new features.
means we are dividing software into small, well-defined modules enables teams to use functions for multiple purposes.

Microservices promotes Agility, Scalability and Resilience so each service can be build, updated and deployed without affecting the rest of the system.

- Benefits of Microservices:
  - Flexible Scaling
  - Easy Deployment
  - Technological Freedom
  - Reusable Code
  - Resilience

- More about Microservices Architecture
  - The application is decomposed into smaller, independent services or microservices such as backend, UI, auth, DB, sms, more.
  - Each microservice is responsible for a specific capability or function and can be developed, deployed, and scaled independently.
  - This follows single responsibility principle.
  - Microservices communicate with each other through lightweight communication mechanisms, such as HTTP/REST APIs or message queues.
  - Individual microservices can be developed using different programming languages, frameworks, and technologies, as long as they adhere to the defined communication protocols.
  - Scaling can be achieved by running multiple instances of individual microservices, rather than scaling the entire application.
  - Microservices architectures promote modularity and scalability.
  - Each microservice can be run on a specific port number.

 
**A2:** A `Microservice` is a software architectural style that structures an application as a collection of small, independent, and loosely coupled services. Each service in a microservices architecture is designed to perform a specific, well-defined function and can run as an independent process. These services communicate with each other through well-defined APIs (typically over HTTP or other lightweight protocols) and often make use of data storage systems and other infrastructure components.

Key characteristics of microservices include:

`Decomposition` - In a microservices architecture, a monolithic application is decomposed into multiple smaller services. Each service is responsible for a specific aspect of the application's functionality. For example, one service might handle user authentication, while another manages product catalog information.

`Independence` - Each microservice is independent and has its codebase, database, and often its technology stack. This independence allows teams to develop, deploy, and scale individual services without affecting the entire application.

`Loose Coupling` - Microservices communicate with each other through well-defined APIs or contracts, which enables loose coupling. This means that changes to one service should not impact other services as long as the API contract remains stable.

`Scalability` - Microservices can be scaled independently. Services that experience higher demand can be scaled out, while others can remain unchanged. This provides efficient resource allocation.

`Flexibility` - Microservices are well-suited for applications that require flexibility. Developers can use different technologies and programming languages for different services, allowing them to choose the best tool for the job.

`Resilience` - Microservices are designed to be resilient. If one service fails, it should not bring down the entire application. Redundancy and failover mechanisms can be implemented.

`Continuous Deployment` - Microservices make it easier to implement continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) practices, as individual services can be deployed and updated independently.

`Ownership` - Teams can take ownership of specific microservices, making it easier to assign responsibility for different parts of the application.

`Microservices` architectures are often used in large and complex applications, such as e-commerce platforms, social media networks, and financial systems, where the ability to scale and maintain individual parts of the system is crucial. However, they also introduce challenges, such as managing inter-service communication, data consistency, and the increased complexity of deployment and monitoring. Proper design, tooling, and best practices are essential to realizing the benefits of a microservices architecture while addressing its challenges.


**A3:** Microservices is an architectural style for developing software applications as a collection of small, independent services that communicate with each other through APIs. Here are the key aspects:

1. Independence: Each microservice is a self-contained unit that can be developed, deployed, and scaled independently of other services.

2. Decentralization: Microservices decentralize the application, allowing for flexibility in development and deployment. Each service can use different technologies and can be updated without affecting the entire application.

3. Scalability: Microservices enable individual services to be scaled independently based on their specific needs, improving resource utilization.

4. Resilience: The failure of one microservice doesn't necessarily impact the entire application. Other services can continue to function, enhancing the overall resilience of the system.

5. Communication via APIs: Microservices communicate through well-defined APIs, exposing endpoints that other services can use to request or send data.

6. Technology Diversity: Microservices allow for the use of different technologies and programming languages for different services, optimizing each for specific tasks.

7. Easy Maintenance and Updates: Updates or changes to one microservice don't necessarily affect the entire application, making maintenance more straightforward.

### Scenarios in Web Development with ReactJS:

#### Load > API call > Render:

- When a React component loads, it initiates an asynchronous API call to a microservice, typically using lifecycle methods (`componentDidMount` for class components or `useEffect` for functional components with hooks).
- The component waits for the API response and, upon receiving the data, renders the content on the user interface.
- This pattern ensures that the UI remains responsive while fetching data.

#### Load > Render > API > Re-render:

- Initially, a React component renders with default or placeholder content.
- After rendering, the component triggers an API call to fetch additional or updated data.
- Upon receiving the response, the component re-renders with the new information, creating a dynamic user interface.
- This approach is useful when you want to display something quickly and then enhance it with real-time or dynamic data.

In the context of microservices, each of these API calls may be directed to a specific microservice responsible for providing the relevant data or functionality. The modular nature of microservices allows for independent development and deployment of different services, contributing to a scalable and maintainable web application architecture.

## Q: What is `Monolith architecture`?
**A1:** A `Monolith architecture` is a traditional model of a software program, which is built as a unified unit that is self-contained and independent from other applications. A monolithic architecture is a singular, large computing network with one code base that couples all of the business concerns together. To make a change to this sort of application requires updating the entire stack by accessing the code base and building and deploying an updated version of the service-side interface. This makes updates restrictive and time-consuming.
means we are not dividing software into small, well-defined modules, we use every services like, database, server or a UI of the application, in one Application file.

Monolith architecuture is a traditional software design approach, which combines the whole software into a single unit, Each and every service like: User Interface, Business logic, frontend, backend, database, APIs all are processed into a single container.
Any small change in any service leads to the whole software to be rebuilt, tested and deployed. Still widely used in small scale companies where Microservices isn't much evident.

Monolith architecture, also known as the monolithic architecture pattern, is a traditional software architectural style in which all the components and functions of an application are tightly integrated and packaged as a single, unified codebase. In a monolithic architecture, the entire application, including the user interface, business logic, and data access layer, is typically built and deployed as a single unit.

- Monolith Architecture
  - Built as a single, indivisible unit.
  - All components of the application (UI, logic, API, Auth, DB, etc.) are tightly coupled and deployed together as a single unit.
  - Scaling the application typically involves replicating the entire monolithic instance on multiple servers or virtual machines.
  - Changes to any part of the application require rebuilding and redeploying the entire monolith.
  - Monolithic architectures are simpler to develop and test initially, but can become more complex and harder to maintain as the application grows in size and complexity.
 
**A2:** A `monolithic` architecture, also known as a monolithic application, is a traditional software architectural style in which an entire application is built as a single, self-contained unit. In a monolithic architecture, all components and functionalities of the application, such as user interfaces, business logic, and data access, are tightly integrated and packaged together. This contrasts with microservices architecture, where the application is decomposed into a collection of small, independent services.

Key characteristics of a monolithic architecture include:

`Single Codebase` - In a monolithic application, all the code for different application parts is typically written in the same codebase. This codebase can be organized into different modules or packages, but it's all part of the same project.

`Tight Coupling` - Components and modules within a monolithic application are tightly coupled, meaning they often depend on each other. Changes to one part of the application can have ripple effects on other parts, making it harder to isolate and maintain individual features.

`Single Deployment Unit` - The entire application is deployed as a single unit. When updates or changes are made, the entire monolith must be redeployed. This can lead to longer deployment cycles and increased risk.

`Scaling Challenges` - Scaling a monolithic application can be challenging. If one part of the application requires more resources to handle increased load, the entire application must be scaled, which can be inefficient.

`Technology Stack` - In a monolithic architecture, the entire application typically uses the same technology stack, programming language, and frameworks. This limits the flexibility to use different technologies for different parts of the application.

`Development Team Structure` - Monolithic applications often have development teams working on different features, but all within the same codebase. Teams need to coordinate closely to avoid conflicts and to ensure changes do not disrupt other parts of the application.

`Testing and Debugging` - Testing and debugging a monolithic application can be complex, as changes can impact various parts of the application. Comprehensive testing is required to ensure that updates do not introduce bugs or break existing functionality.

`Resource Allocation` - All resources, such as databases and servers, are shared among the components of the monolith, which can lead to resource contention and performance issues.

Monolithic architectures are a common choice for smaller applications and for projects where simplicity and speed of development are prioritized. However, as applications grow in complexity and scale, monolithic architectures can become less maintainable and harder to evolve. This has led to the adoption of alternative architectures like microservices, which decompose the application into smaller, more manageable components.
